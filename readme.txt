-----Gold and Silver Ukakagaka-----

Yooooo thanks for checking out the readme. Here's some info.

This is a ghost based off of the characters Gold and Silver, specifically the ones I made up while playing Heart Gold on a Randomizer. Gold's personality is very influenced by my own playthrough and the stories I made up for him while playing. This isn't based off of any pre-existing version of the character in the mangas, for example.

This ghost is meant to be chill, so they don't have a relationship system. You can feel free to click around and ask about anything you want without having to worry.

Features:
- Basic ghost funcions
  - That being email checking, emptying recycling bin, updating themselves, and more.
- Filled out menu where you can ask them questions and whatnot
- You can ask about any Pokemon and they'll tell you their opinion on it in any relating thoughts. Try to fill out the Dex!
  - This only goes up to Gen 9 and exludes most regional varients and past/future forms from Scarlet and Violet
- Sometimes they might release their Pokemon to sit on the desktop with them

CREDITS:
Zarla - The Radic and Farnsworth ghost was VERY inspirational for this project. This ghost wouldn't have been made without them! http://www.ashido.com/nplu/ghost/index.html

Worm - Directly helped with coding the Pokédex

Bulbapedia - I cannot stress enough how useful this website was. If I was working on this ghost, chances are this website was open. There is no way I could've accurately written about every single Pokémon without it. https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki

Smogon - The wiki and its community were very helpful in many aspects, in particular providing 200+ pixel sprites (individual credits are found the same place the sprites are) https://www.smogon.com/

WolfeyVGC - His videos about competative Pokémon were beyond helpful, especially his video on every single dual type. https://www.youtube.com/@WolfeyVGC

False Swipe Gaming - The many videos about the history of particular Pokémon competatively was incredibly informative and helpful https://www.youtube.com/@FalseSwipeGaming
