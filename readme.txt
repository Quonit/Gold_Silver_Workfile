-----Gold and Silver Ukakagaka-----

Yooooo thanks for checking out the readme. Here's some info.

This is a ghost based off of the characters Gold and Silver, specifically the ones I made up while playing Heart Gold on a Randomizer. Gold's personality is very influenced by my own playthrough and the stories I made up for him while playing. This isn't based off of any pre-existing version of the character in the mangas, for example.

This ghost is meant to be chill, so they don't have a relationship system. You can feel free to click around and ask about anything you want without having to worry.

Features:
- Basic ghost funcions
  - That being email checking, emptying recycling bin, updating themselves, and more.
- Filled out menu where you can ask them questions and whatnot
- You can ask about any Pokemon and they'll tell you their opinion on it in any relating thoughts. Try to fill out the Dex!
  - This only goes up to Gen 9 and exludes most regional varients and past/future forms from Scarlet and Violet
- Sometimes they might release their Pokemon to sit on the desktop with them
