//THIS IS THE BIG ONE: Where every single piece of dialogue for every single Pokemon goes.
//The story goes early February my hand was injured and I could no longer draw, meaning that most of my projects were canceled and I didn't have anything to do. So, I was looking for a time waster project, and started writing down dialogue for every single Pokemon. Then my hand didn't heal promptly within the next 2 months and I continued doing this.
//Of course there's all the Pokemon dialogue here, but I also try to keep any comments I have about it here as well! So now, people like you can read a little bit behind the scenes about it! Hopefully some of the commentaries a little interesting or funny.

//Gen 1
Bulbasaur_ivysaur_venusaur_charmander_charmeleon_charizard_squirtle_wartortle_blastoise
{
//G: Silver you're very lizard-core to me. I think if you had to pick between the Kanto starters you'd fit Charizard best. It's red and got a dragon mouth.
//G: And not that shineys are relavent, but the shiny IS black and red.
//S: Aren't they all lizards...?
//G: If I had a Kanto starter... Hmmm I dunno! I like all of them. Though what I'd REALLY want is a Wartortle. But, like, bigger.
//S: ...Blastiose?
//G: No I mean like, if it got dragon ears and a more whispy tail.
//G: Bulbasaur is cool too though. It's got flowers on it!
}
caterpie_metapod_butterfree
{
//G: I think Butterfree are so pretty... They get so many beautiful designs on their wings!
//G: In Kanto you can find Caterpie, Metapod, and Butterfree *everywhere*. If you went into the forest and said you didn't see any, I wouldn't believe you!
//G: There are a bunch of young trainers with them too, since they're so easy to capture.
//S: Most of those trainers end up releasing the Butterfree later.
//G: Well... Yeah, that's true. Butterfree have a migration cycle, and trainers pretty much always let them go for that.
//S: Their team's viability is better off without the Pokemon anyways. Butterfree's uses are fairly limited to teaching young trainers the bear basics of raising a pokemon, as it's easy to catch and evolves quickly.
//G: You're making it sound as if the only people who would ever even think of raising a Butterfree are young kids!
//S: More people *would* think of raising a Butterfree, but weather serious trainers *should* is different.
//S: Butterfree are good Pokemon for education, gardening, pets, decoration. They're useful for people who aren't Pokemon trainers but still want just one to protect them on common routes.
//S: However, they're completely unsuitable for serious competition. Their Bug/Flying Typing gives them many, many common weaknesses and very few strengths. They are incredibly frail, especially physically but how they fare against special attacks isn't anything impressive either. They're easily outsped by anything not anchored to the ground in some way. 
//S: It can't hit hard physically, and hundreds of Pokemon easily outclass it in what it can do with its Special Attack. The nieche it has going for it is that it has compound eyes that raise its accuracy, making the usually unreliable powders that inflicting Sleep, Stun, and Poison practical.
//S: There are other Pokemon, even among common ones that are easily caught, that can still inflict those statuses that are better in every other regard.
//G: Are you mad because the Kanto Champion has one?
//S: You mean the /former/ Kanto Champion who hasn't been seen in months, who only won due to an embarrassing fluke on the system's part because her same-aged child rival had managed to become Champion right before, meaning THAT'S who her opponant was instead of an actual expert?
//G: I mean... I wouldn't write, uh... the former Kanto Champion off so soon, 'still had to get all the badges and through the Elite Four.
//G: Plus, the whole Team Rocket thing! You've gotta have some respect for that, right? You hate those guys.
//S: Anyone with enough guts to attempt it can beat Team Rocket. They're all incompetant bumbling fools and it's a testament to their ineffectuality that they were beaten by a trainer who relies on Butterfree.
//G: Or maybe the world is more flexible than you think? Maybe it's just possible that if you love a Pokemon enough and are a good enough trainer, then any of them can be better?
//G: And, like, maaaaayyyybe the reason most Butterfree don't do so well is because those little kids that catch them all the time don't know or care to train them to their full potential? Especially since a lot of them release them so soon.
//S: You're unlikely to convince me on this point.
//G: For someone who doesn't like Butterfree, you sure do have a lot to say about it compared to other Pokemon you think are weak... Usually you just write them off, not go on an angry rant.
}
weedle_kakuna_beedrill
{
//G: It's not that I hate Beedrill or anything, but I do think that I'm lucky I started training in Johto, not Kanto! If me and my Ralts got swarmed by a bunch of angry Beedrill, we would have never made it out of that forest alive!
//G: Now that I think about it, I wonder if Tala has any Beedrill... She's got, uh, a big interest in beekeeping.
//S: That's putting it mildly, from I heard.
}
pidgey_pidgeotto_pidgeot
{
//G: For YEARS I thought the line was Pidgy, Pidgeot, then Pidgeotto. It just makes intuitive sense for the name to keep getting longer each time it evolves! I feel like someone must've typed it down wrong.
//S: ...So what, are you going to charge up to the office of Mr.Pokemon-Namer and ask him to change the names?
//G: Maybe I will! You don't know I won't.
}
rattata_raticate
{
//G: Does anyone actually... Like them
//G: They're used by Team Rocket grunts all the time, because they're common and easy to catch, but is there anyone who's best friend is a Rattata?
//S: ...Obviously?
//G: I wonder what a well groomed Raticade looks like. I only see them when they're all scruffy. You could probably do a lot with that hair!
}
spearow_fearow
{
//G: It must be weird evolving from Spearow to a Fearow! They've got completely different beaks. Wouldn't they need to learn how to eat different?
//S: Have you ever considered... That Ho_Oh you allegedly encountered and defeated with Honoa... Perhaps it was a colorful Fearow?
//G: Whaat, no way! They look totally different.
//G: ...Actually, no, you might have a point.
}
ekans_arbok
{
//G: I heard that Arbok's fake-face pattern matches their trainers if it was attached enough to them when it evolves!
//G: Not that I've seen enough Arbok to tell... Most of the Ekans and Arbok's I've seen were just being used by Rocket grunts.
//S: Some Arbok have rare patterns that are sought out by collectors...
//G: ooooo interesting.
}
pikachu
{
//G: Pikachu... Pi-ka-chu... Sorry, I can't seem to recall any Pokemon by that name.
//G: PFFF NAH I was just messing with you. COULD YOU IMAGINE THOUGH?
//S: Easily.
//G: There's more advertizements with a Pikachu on them than there are actual Pikachu, I swear.
}
raichu_pichu
{
//G: Surprise!
//S: ...?
//G: That's what Tala named her Raichu, heh. It's /always/ funny.
//S: For some reason I struggle to believe that.
//G: Poor Pichu and Raichu, though... There are some people who doesn't even know Raichu EXISTS because of how popular Pikachu is! They're like... What do you mean it can evolve! Why would I do that!
//G: So, Pokedex. How Pokemon are indexed is that you give the first Pokemon in an evolution line a number, so, like, number 25. Then the second number is how many times it's evolved. It'd be like, Pichu 25.0, Pikachu 25.1, and then Raichu 25.2. And 25 would be known as "The Pichu Line".
//EXCEPT, this is the ONLY LINE where it's NOT named after the first Pokemon in the evolution! It's just CALLED the Pikachu line! Because they only indexed Pichu later and didn't want to change it.
//S: I heard there's a rare evolution after Raichu.
//G: Whaaat? No way, you're joking.
//S: There's no pictures of it, but there's some documents describing a pokemon evolved from Raichu named "Gorochu".
//G: That's SO COOL!!! I hope someone finds it again some day- I'd like to see that.
}
sandshrew_sandslash
{
//G: Silver has a Sandshrew!
//S: [Looking away] It's a Sandslash.
//G: It's not from Kanto though- He got it while trading. It's from Alola and it's an Ice Type!
//S: ...
//G: Its name is Popcicle.
//S: Its previous owner named it that before I got it and I didn't bother changing it.
//G: Silver why don't you show %(username)!!!
//S: |: No
//G: Pretty pleeeaase? Pretty please which a Cherubi on top?
//S: Have I ever once caved to your incessant pleading?
//G: What if.... I gave you 500 Pokedollars.
//S: You already buy me items. I don't need more.
//G: Sighhh
}
nidoran_nidorino_nidorina_nidoqueen_nidoking
{
//G: Hey %(username), have you ever seen a shiny Nidoqueen?
//S: [sigh]
//G: The shinies are really cute! The boys are normally purple, the girls are normally blue, so their shinies swap colors! Boy Nidoran is blue, Nidorino is blue, Nidoking is blue, then girl Nidorina is purple, Nidorina is purple, and Nidoqueen is... Look it up for yourself!
/*
	G: Nidoking are such big and imposing Pokémon... It's a good thing they're so loudly colored. That way you can see 'em comin' from a mile away.
	G: They're not quite purple and not quite pink... I guess it's fushia?
	S: It's spelled "fuchsia".
	G: Only someone from Kanto would know how to spell it by heart.
	S: And they have more color variety than that.
	G: Yeah yeah, some are more pink, some are more purple, but it's all shades of fuchia.
	S: You're still spelling it wrong.
	G: I can mispell fuchia in ways you can't even imagine.
	S: Uhhggggggg...

}
clefairy_clefable_cleffa
{
//G: While in Kanto I traveled to Mt.Moon, and it's said there are Clefairy living there- but I didn't see any. They're rare I'm told, so it's expected, but it would've been kinda cool to see!
//S: They normally only come out during full moons, and even then they're aversed to humans.
//G: There's an idea, we could go there during a full moon and hike around the mountain! Even if we don't spot any Clefairy, it could be fun.
//S: You want to hike around a dangerous mountain during night when you can't /see/ anything?? Are you /looking/ for trouble?
//G: Hm... Yeah maybe I didn't think that one through.
}
vulpix_ninetales
{
//G: I've always liked Vulpix! But I've never caught one. I spotted a couple small ones while traveling- but I didn't want to bother them. They weren't causing me trouble and were probably still young enough that they had a Mom taking care of them.
//G: I always pictured myself with a Vulpix in my team when I got old enough to have Pokemon, but sometimes fate just has different plans, y'know?
}
jigglypuff_wigglytuff_igglybuff
{
//G: Here's a tip for if you ever go to Kanto: /avoid Jigglypuff/. You're probably not going to run into any, but if you do, don't mess with them! They're not just cute to be cute like Swirlex, they're real menaces! Specifically the wild ones.
//S: ...You ran into one?
//G: One put me and Konkurs to sleep right outside town!! Who knows what could've happened to my Flygon if someone nefarious spotted it...
}
zubat_golbat_crobat
{
//G: People were right... Zubat are EVERYWHERE in Kanto caves! Even when I was quiet as possible a zubat would sneak up on me and start biting my bag or trying to attack me! Either I could run away or try to fight back, and both options just woke up MORE ZUBATS!
//G: They make these high pitched cries that gave me the worst headaches I've ever had in my young life!
//G: I felt pretty bad attacking them too. Just sort of... Hyper-Beamed the entire area. The floor had so many knocked out Zubats.
//G: I know that's their natural habitat but people should really make more accessible pathways that don't involve going through those caves... I just don't imagine it's safe for everyone! And it's probably not safe for the Zubats for Trainers to be traveling through it either.
//G: ...Oh yeah, Silver, don't you have a Crobat?
//S: I was hoping you'd forgotten.
}
oddish_gloom_vileplume_bellossom
{
//G: Between Vileplume and Bellossom, I definitely think Bellossom is better.
//S: Depends on what you're doing... Vileplume is a better Special Attacker.
//G: Yeah, but that giant flower on its head limits its vision!
//S: There are plenty of good Pokemon with limited vision.
//G: "Good" Pokemon?
//S: You started it with comparing one or the other as "Better"!
//G: Yeah but- ...No, you have a point. I AM NOT FREE OF BIAS!
}
paras_parasect
{
//G: Paras are SO creepy. They look cute in pictures- Err, kind of, but when you're in a cave, they're so short you don't see them until they're TOUCHING YOUR LEG
//G: I didn't mean to kick it!!! It was just a reflexive response! I thought it was going to cut my leg with its sharp claws!
//S: It might've.
//G: See, I was justified! D:
//G: Don't tell Tala though.... She has a Parasect and would be soooooo upset with me for saying that.
}
venonat_venomoth
{
//G: One of my first memories as a baby is with a venonat!
//G: I think I was in the backyard of my old house... One was there and I started petting it.
//G: Then my Mom got really worried and made me take a bath, since Venonat are part Poison type.
//G: ...I guess it's not the most interesting story, but most first memories are like that!
//G: Anyways, have you ever thought that Venonat looks a lot like Butterfree?
//S: It's thought the two have a shared ancestory...
//G: Haha nice!!!
}
diglet_dugtrio
{
//G: I crossed Diglet cave once! It was a lot of looking at my feet to make sure I wasn't accidentally playing Wack-O-Mole. I had Norma out with me, since she likes rolling in the dirt so much.
//S: Might've been a good idea to have used Honoa...
//G: Right, water type. I didn't want to ruin their home is all!
//S: It would've been fine.
//G: MAYBE, but what if I drowned some poor guy!!! I'd be responsible for murder.
//S: [rolls eyes]
}
meowth_persian
{
//S: ...
//G: I've always thought Persian looked so different from Meowth... Like, I'd expect an evolution to look more anthro-pra-morphic.
//S:
//G: So I can definitely understand the people who don't evolve their Meowths. That's like turning it into a completely different person!
//S: ...
//G: Whats up?
//S: I knew a Persian growing up.
//G: Oooo neat! I've seen people with small Dog pokemon and Glameows as pets, but weirdly not a lot of Persians. Did it have a name?
//S: I'm not interested in talking about it.
//G: Mysterious as always.
}
psyduck_golduck
{
//G: I've always felt bad for Psyducks! I mean, why would the world be cruel enough to just have something exist that ALWAYS has headaches? They can evolve out of it sure, but that's just mean!
//G: Poor things... Golduck is pretty cool looking though.
//S: It's... fine. Other Water Types outclass it.
//G: Isn't it part Psychic?
//S: No, it just learns Psychic moves.
//G: What??? Dang, it seems a lot of Kanto Pokémon are like that.
}
mankey_primeape_ANNIHILAPE
{
//G: My Mom used to read me stories about Mankey. It went something like...
//G: Once there was an Angry Mankey. His friends asked, whats the problem? But instead of answering, he screamed and shouted at them.
//G: They brought him gifts to try to cheer him up, but he threw them on the floor and destroyed them. The angrier he got, the bigger he got! He turned into a Primeape
//G: Nothing his friends did would work. So they decided to leave him alone.
//G: But he was angry, so he started taking it out on others- pushing them over because of his bad mood.
//G: The more he bullied, the bigger he got. Everyone was scared of him because of how mean he was being!
//G: Then he got SO big and SO mean, that he explodes and dies. The end.
//S: ... O_O
//G: It's basically a story about how you should tell other people your problems instead of bottling them upthen taking your frustration out on other people? Or something. I dunno why it got so dark though!
//S: I mean... That is what happens to Mankeys...
//G: They DIE?
//S: Annihilape is part Ghost Type.
//G: That's... Pretty fucked up!
}
growlithe_arcanine
{/*
G: Can you believe that /both/ Champions have an Arcanine?
S: There's only one Champion at a time.
G: Fine then, the /most recent/ Champions then.
S: I can easily believe they both have an Arcanine. It's a strong Pokémon.
G: Well, I don't think they were picking it just based on strength.
S: I would hope they were picking Arcanine based on strength, otherwise the fact they won would be even more embarrassing than it already is.
G: The two other Pokemon they shared were Pidgeot and Eevee. Though, the Eevee one is a little bit different- one of them was a Jolteon.
S: I'm surprised that Blue brought the Pidgeot even once considering he has three other Flying Types and brought one of them in both fights.
S: Jolteon is fine.
G: I wonder if it was an accident or they were copying each other on purpose. I'd ask blue but... I'm way too shy.
S: You're not /shy/.
G: I am around him! He's so cool... I don't want to embarrass myself!

poliwag_poliwhirl_poliwrath_politoed
{
//G: Politoad is real cute...
//G: Why is Polywrath basically just Poliwhirl with a raised fist? That's like, barely a difference.
//S: Evolution's an evolution. It's not just about appearance, it's the change in power.
//G: Is there ANY Pokemon that changes less than Poliwrath?
//S: ...Palophin?
//G: That's a Paliphin.
//S: Paldeon Pokemon.
//G: Ah, so that's why I haven't heard of it.
}
abra_kadabra_alakazam
{
//G: I teleported with an Abra once! It was ONE OF THE SCARIEST THINGS I'VE EVER WENT THROUGH.
//S: Haven't been through a lot of scary things, then.
//G: Do you know what it's like to have your body EVAPORATED? I mean it doesn't hurt at all- It just feels weird, and it's not a GOOD weird. It's like if you saw yourself bleeding but didn't actually feel any pain. Like, yeah something's WRONG, and it's worrying it doesn't FEEL worse.
//G: For what a brief experience it is it's TERRIFYING! I'm lucky that I don't get nightmares.
}
machop_machoke_machamp
{
//G: I remember finding it really cool when I first saw some Machoke helping with constructing a building... I guess up to that point I thought of Pokemon as either pets or "some hobby Trainers have", but hadn't really thought a lot about their utility and how they make a lot of jobs for humans way easier.
//G: Like... Electricity! Pokemon help a lot with generating that. And travel is so much easier with anyone being able to hop on a dragon to get somewhere.
}
bellsprout_weepinbell_victreebel_victreebell
{
//"Victreebel look funny in pictures but wait till you actually encounter one... Not as funny anymore when it looks like it could eat you!
//S: It intimidation quickly disappears when it's... on fire.
//G: Did I ever tell you what happened with Tala's Victreebell??? She got an egg from Professor Elm and carried it around. It hatched while she was in Ilex Forest, and instead of a Billsprout, it came out a full grown Victreebel!
//S: Sounds like spinning tall tales is a talant that runs in the family.
//G: It really happened!!! You can ask Professor Elm about it, he knows it did!
//S: The bluffing is new...
//G: I'm dead serious dude!

tentacool_tentacruel
{/*
	G: Oh, Silver, didn't you used to have a Tentacruel?
	S: I did.
	G: That's right, I remember! It's the Pokémon you surfed on while we were at the Lake of Rage! Man, that thing was /scary/ looking.
	S: It did try to kill me...
	G: What!? Like, in retaliation?
	S: No. I first found it out in the wild. I didn't notice it, and when it got too close it grabbed me and tried to drown me.
	G: And you managed to catch it in a Pokéball??
	S: It's not like my other Pokémon could fight it underwater. They'd likely just drown or kill me.
	G: That's /lucky/. I had no idea you came so close to death!
	S: Of the Pokémon I released, the Tentacruel was the one I was most reluctant to free because of how useful it had been to me... However it was only ever a tool or trophy, so I let it go.
	G: So /that's/ why you don't have a Water Type, since you never needed anything other than the Tentacruel and never got anything else to replace it.
	S: Mhm.
	G: You're so cool.
	S: Whatever.

geodude_graveler_golem

ponyta_rapidash

G: [with dex] Ohh, see here, it says that its fire mane will burn anyone who touches... /Unless/, it's someone they trust.

magnemite_magneton_magneton
{
//G: Aparently, Magnemite are really popular. Not with trainers- I mean they're common so some trainers still have them, and magneton can be... a lot to deal with...
//G: But it's mostly with companies! Since they're a good source of energy.
//G: Aparently you can find Magnemite in every region now just because of that...
//G: Hey Silver, are Magnemite an invasive species?
//S: It depends on if they harm the ecosystem or not.
//G: Do they?
//S: If they do there's cover ups preventing it from being wide knowledge... Many companies that use Magnemite have to sign Government Enviornmental Protection forms though, since using Pokemon for labor is restricted... and the forms include preventing their Pokemon from damaging the surroundings.
//G: How do you know all this!!! You're so smart.

farfetchd
{
//G: Was giving away Pokemon Eggs... the one I got turned out to be a Farfetch'd.

//S: *Might* have three heads, because we don't actually know it exists.
//G: It's like a Dodrio but it's super super small and it's got so much fluff on it that it looks like three heads poking out of a bird nest.
//G: It's not in the Pokedex, because no one's been able to find one to study yet or figure out how to hatch one that way, but there's a COUPLE pictures.
//S: Without studying it though we don't know if the ones that had photos taken of them were one-off mutations, or completely different Pokemon.
//G: Oh, like a regional variant?
//G: Well I think the implication of Doduo having three heads as babies is really interesting... Like, they evolve and one gets sucked into the body, but then comes back out when it's ready.
//S: Is it the same consiousness though?
//G: Is the third consiousness sucked into the body and just LIVES in the body until it gets pushed out again??? Like totally blind??? Does it have any control over the body or anything?

//S: They are a real enviornmental threat, though. There's been action trying to limit the number of them and attempts to find ways to make them safer.

//G: I'd like to fight a really really strong Onix, I think that would be a fun challenge
//S: Have you never encountered a Steelix?

//G: Had to make it very clear to me I could look and not touch.
//G: I don't remember it very well. I definitely don't remember any Krabby, but I do remember walking around in the sand...
//G: It's a shame that place is gone now.

voltorb_electrode
{
//G: So did the Pokeball invent the Voltorb, or did the Voltorb invent the Pokeball?
//S: A Pokeball can't invent anything it's an inanimate object.
//G: You know what I meant!
//S: When pokeballs used to be made out of wood, voltorbs were also made out of wood.
//G: Were they literally made out of wood or did they just look like it?
//s: Obviously just looked like it they're living creatures
//G: Well they're a Pokemon with plants growing off of them, I don't see why there can't be Pokemon that are partially made out of wood
//G: I mean rock type is mostly just literally rocks.
//S: They also don't look like that anymore so we can't test it
//G: Man those things are confusing.

exeggcute_exeggutor
{
//G: When I first saw the alolan exeggutor, I thought it was just a normal evolution. ALL exeggutors should get long necks!
//S: Any Exxeggutor can evolve into it regardless of origin...
//G: WOAH REALLY??
//S: There are some downsides to evolving it, though.
//G: Like what, the complications from replacing a Psychic Type with a Dragon Typing?
//S: Like not being able to fit it inside of buildings.
//G: Oh, yeah, I GUESS.

cubone_marowak
{
//When I was a kid I heard that cubone's skull is from its dead mom. But, like, there's a lot of cubones! They can't ALL be from their dead moms.
//S: That's just the first cubone. It was a kangaskid, then it became its own pokemon when it evolved with its skull... So it had its children just be born with the outer skull.
//G: That's WICKED COOL

lickitung_lickilicky

//G: When people said Lickitung were gross, I mean, I thought I understood why they thought that, but I didn't believe them. They're pink and cute looking! From the pictures.

	S: Breathing in the powder moves most Bug and Grass Type Pokémon learn can also lead to days long sickness...
	G: /Right./ Especially if you're traveling alone, you don't want to end up suddenly sleeping in the middle of the forest for days! You'll wake up eventually, but that's not gonna be fun at /all/!

chansey_blissey_happiny

//G: I've only ever seen Chansey and Blissey in Pokecenters. I know that Happiny exist, and some trainers have Chanseys, but I haven't actually seen them...

horsea_seadra_kingdra
{/*
	G: I had noooo /idea/ horsea evolved into a Dragon Type for the longest time. They're just so cute and common! Who knew they could turn into something so strong!
	S: The first stages of Dragon Types are usually very weak. It's a common trait among them, that they take a long time to raise to full power.
	G: Well, part of the reason I was so surprised when I first really connected the dots is because Horsea kind of kicks ass on its own sometimes. Like, it's a perfectly fine Water Type. Nothin' ta sneeze at.
	S: It's /significantly/ better as Kingdra.
	G: Maybe some of 'em are! I feel that a really well trained Horsea could easily match most Seadra.
	S: But if that well-trained pokemon had more power...
	G: Are you just mad that the champion had one?
	S: Hmph.
	G: Horsea doesn't even get its Dragon Type 'till it's fully evolved, it didn't need that to succeed!
	S: Do you know that to evolve a Seadra into a Kingdra involves trading it?
	G: CRUEL honestly.
	S: That's most likely why you didn't know about its final evolution for so long. Most trainers wouldn't want to trade their Kingdra away.
	G: I could never trade any of mine away, unless it was someone I really knewww... Like you!

//G: I'll be honest, Staryu and Starmie scare me!
//G: They have feelings like any other Pokemon... Presumably... But they don't have faces. Not being able to tell how they're feeling freak me out.
//G: When they faint, their gem powers down like they're an ancient robot...
//S: Staryu and Starmie can easily regenerate any limb as long as the core is kept in tact. The core's red light flickers at the same rate as a human heartbeat.
//G: Ahhg. freaky.
//S: People sometimes like to wear its core as jewelry.
//G: O_O???
//S: They're known to live up to 500 years, and are one of the oldest still living species of Pokemon known. Their gems send radio waves to the night sky, so some people suspect they might have extraterestrial origins.

S: Scizor is a pretty Solid Pokemon as far as Bug Types go... It has a Steel Type, which gives it a lot of defences... It has a lot of speedy priority moves and a high attack, so if you had to use a bug type it's not the worst.
G: Yeah, but to even get one of those you need to do this whole trade thing with a Metal Coat. Not easy!

G: Ice types are great! I have always wondered though... I kind of thought that it, Electabuzz, and Magmar were sort of part of a trio, but does Jynx have an evolution like they do?

S: Mono Bug.
G: Okay, I'll be honest. I miiiight have /just a little bit/ of a bug phobia. I don't hate bugs at all- It's just- Well, it's a phobia! Phobias are irrational fears. If I go outside and I see ants all over the ground, I raised my leg up and run back inside! I have to keep brushing my legs with my hands to make sure there aren't any on me, even though they're definitely wouldn't be!
S: That sounds... Rather inconvenient? You spend all of your time outside.
G: With long socks and sneakers! I'm totally protected! And everything in my bag is inside of plastic so that bugs can't eat it! Even though I've never actually had any bugs in my bag because that is super insulated too, and I never leave it on the floor...
G: Not to mention before I was a trainer I would help with my mom's garden all the time. Which, like, /obviously bugs are a part of gardens/... so usually I stuck with indoor plants or cooking. Gardening gloves did help though!
G: It's also part of why I wear gloves! I keep a spare in my bag.
S: Didn't you have a Masquerain...?
G: IT DOESN'T USUALLY APPLY TO POKÉMON! Like, they usually lack some very specific insectoid features that creep me out. Like, I don't think I've ever been scared of Caterpie.
G: But there's /one/ Pokemon that does trigger this bug phobia.

G: I didn't go there intentionally after hearing the news like most people did- I was just passing through the area since that happened to have the nearest Pokécenter. I think it was right after I got Banco...?
G: There was a harsh storm, strong winds, thunder claps, lots of rain, and when I turned on the radio there was a weird noise repeating over and over again.
G: Turns out, the "weird noise" on the radio was a signal from Team Rocket that was making all the Pokémon act strange. The storm was being caused by a red Gyarados in the lake.
G: It wasn't red because it was born a shiny gold Magikarp, though- it was red because due to stress it had evolved /way/ too quickly. It was creating the storm, and people couldn't even begin to approach it because of how angry it was! Thrashing and attacking anything that came near it in the lake.
G: It was causing a lot of problems, and someone needed to get rid of it before it hurt itself or others, so I went out to battle it myself.
G: Silver was there too, actually.
S: [Turned away] ...
G: I think you were trying to catch it, actually. So you were fine with teaming up with me to fight it- or, I guess less "team up" and more "fight it at the same time", as long as I didn't steal the catch, or interfering some other way.
G: We didn't get along very much at the time so it was kind of a first.
G: Right as we knocked it out, though, and Silver was going to catch it, at the last second the Johto Champion /Lance/ showed up! Then /he/ caught it instead!
G: You were soooo mad. The storms subsided since the Gyarados was gone, and I definitely remember you getting mad about being cheated out of your catch, since you were there first and did most of the actual fighting.
S: Well it's his Pokemon now, and he still has it, so there's no reason to bring it up again.
G: I don't even think you have a water type right now! Kind of funny, since that's the most common type! That Gyarados sure would have been useful if you did catch it.
S: ...I don't think I would have kept it.
G: Yeah, you released most of your Pokemon, didn't you?
S: Some of them were traded.
G: Righttt. I know Lance still has the Gyarados, I just haven't seen it in a while. I hope it's doing well.

//S: Lapras are...

//G: Easier still really popular though, so most of them are gotten from breeders To give people as gifts, especially when it comes to first Pokemon. People being able to have a lot more choice of what it turns into makes it more personal feeling.
//G: When I won the League, people were giving me a bunch of interviews. In one of them, a lady gifted me an Eevee! I really wasn't planning on raising an Eevee, but she was really insistant and the Eevee was so cute...

//G: Imagine if I had evolved Citrus into a Vaporeon. That'd be soooo weird.
//G: The contrast sounds nice though, critrus fruits are most commonly orange yellow and green, and those all go well with blue.

G: How'd I been more eager to catch Pokemon when I was early on in my journey, it's very likely I would have had one of these.
G: I wanted a small team, though! Most trainers I knew wanted to have a lot of Pokemon, which is probably a smarter idea because it means you have more coverage for different kinds of battles...
G: ...But I only ever wanted the Pokemon that I connected with immediately.
G: I guess I could defend it by saying that I didn't want one that I wasn't sure I'd be friends with, but that's not true. Most trainers end up bonding with their Pokemon /after/ they're caught. And not ALL my catches were love at first sight.
G: ...Wait, that's not actually true. At least, on MY end it was always love at first sight.

G: I have a Wooper! Or, had. I gave it to Tala.
G: You know, I think it's pretty interesting that Bongo still hasn't evolved. Do you think he can't?
S: Some Pokemon just... Don't. Evolution is /usually/ caused when a pokemon battles enough that it's body "thinks" it needs to get stronger to adapt to its environment better... which is why there's a lot more pokemon in the wild that are unevolved, they just don't battle as often as they would if they were being trained...
G: But Bongo's definitely battled a lot. Even before tala got him, he was fighting off wild Agron in the cave I found him in.
S: Sometimes it's caused by a Pokemon lacking willpower to evolve. If it doesn't want to, some Pokemon can just stop their body from transforming. Not all of them are capable of this and they'll just evolve against their will.
G: Well that's sad...
S: Sometimes if one of a Pokemon's parents are a single stage, rarely it can cause the trait of not being able to evolve. This is rare and also depends on the species how likely that is to happen, and it's a little difficult to research.
G: I'd imagine.
S: Another case could be if it were exposed to an Everstone. If a Pokemon absorbs the magic of an Everstone, then it will never evolve.
G: Well, I did find him in a cave. Maybe there was one in there?
S: It's technically possible.
G: I wonder if he even knows. He might have just eaten one as a baby and never found out, or maybe he's never touched in everstone in his life and he's just as confused as everyone else.

S: Your Houndour also would've been effected by Atrract, so it's unlikely you would have been able to use it at all then. The same goes for your Chinchou, though if you had a paralysis move and were able to use it before Stomp or a high Rollout, that would be valuable.
S: I mentioned your Kirlia earlier but I do not think that it would've been able to do enough offense. The strongest move it would've /had/ at that point is Magical Leaf, and on Kirlia that isn't even that powerful.
G: How do you remember that off the top of your head?
S: You wouldn't have been able to do enough damage with Kirlia to offset Milk Drink, Chinchou has incredibly low defensives and would've been easily knocked out with Stomp or Rollout, Houndour would be immobilized from Attract, and Skitty is...
G: The MVP! Norma is both immune to Miltank's attract, and had many status moves of her own. She was a really good singer so could put it to sleep, and while it's sleeping she could Double Slap it or pull a lucky Assist! She definitely could have won!
S: ...I suppose even a Skitty is useful in some situations.
G: "To defeat your enemy you must know your enemy", by using cute female Normal Pokémon with Attract tactices.
G: Regardless, you shouldn't discount Skitty so fast! It defeated your Groudon single-handedly!
S: It did not, because I didn't have a Groundon!
G: Hehehe.

G: Then, do you want to know what Pokemon the guy at the top pulls? A Ho_Oh.
S: It wasn't a Ho_Oh.
G: My team fought valiantly, but in the end the Fire/Flying Legendary was too much for us. I left the tower defeated, trying to figure out a new solution.
G: My team doesn't have any answers to Fire or Flying Types. The best we can hope for is neutral damage. I decided that I need a new Pokemon, and I went out in search for one.
G: That's when I found a Chinchou! A Water/Electric Type, two types /perfectly matched against/ the Fire/Flying Ho_Oh!
G: I go back, we see a true example of "Electric moves are super effective against Flying Types", he obviously beats it, and now he is the real /legend/.

S: Sometimes I wonder how much of it is exaggerated...
G: So back when I was still traveling in Johto- Maybe like almost 2 years ago now? Me and my Pokemon ended up in a cave.
G: It was really spacious- Or at least some parts of it were. There was a bit of a waterfall in there, and me and my Pokemon had to be careful because there were a few places where we could fall over an edge.
G: There were a few different wild Pokemon in the cave. Some Zubats, but actually not as many as you'd think. There were actually quite a few water Pokemon hanging around the pools... I remember a Poliwag, a Slowbrow, a few Marill...
G: And, of course, some Wooper!\x
G: At some point a bunch of Zubat got really disturbed and started flying around, and me and my Pokemon were on edge. Suddenly, a huge Aggron appeared!
G: It was really big and powerful! If I battled it, even if we managed to faint it, my Pokemon could have gotten injured without a Pokécenter nearby. But, at the same time, it would have been really difficult to run away. I could have risked falling off of the edge if I went too fast or tripped, and the Agron could have caught me anyways!\x
G: Just as I was about to panic, the Agron got hit by a blast from behind. It was a Tropius with a Wooper on its head! The Tropius, with its strength, and the Wooper, with its speed, they got the Agron to go away and saved me.
G: The rest of my team, which was just Silklay, Atticus, Norma, Honoa, and Drugia at the time, were super grateful, too. The Tropius and Wooper decided to show us their home so that we could have somewhere to rest before we went the rest of our way through the cave.
G: All my Pokemon got along really well with the rest of Tropius and Wooper's family there- Like there was this one Quagsire who I think was siblings with the Wooper? There were also a few Diglett and a Rhyhorn.
G: We found out that that particular aggron had been a problem for a lot of the Pokemon living in this cave. It was really territorial and would often fight or attack the other pokemon in the cave that lived there.\x
G: My Pokemon all got rested up, and when we set out to leave the next day, the Tropius and Wooper decided they were going to stick with us until the end of the cave, just for extra protection.
G: And it was /definitely/ needed. As we were just about finding the path to the exit, it jumped out at us roaring mad!
G: This time, with more solid ground and two more pokemon on our side, we were able to defeat it rather than just scare it off!
S: So what does defeat mean in this context?
G: I didn't murder a Pokemon! At least I don't think so.
G: When I reach the exit, finally seeing the light of day once more, sun fading into twilight, I waved goodbye to my friends I had met in the cave and started to walk off.
G: As I was walking away, on the road to the next city to continue on my own independent journey, the Wooper started running after me!
G: With the Aggron gone, the Tropius and Wooper didn't need to protect everyone anymore. Their home was safe now!
G: So, the Wooper convinced the Tropius to come with me!
G: And that's how I got Banco the Tropius and Bongo the Wooper! Though, Bongo didn't stay in my team very long.
S: It's definitely the most dramatic of all your Pokemon's backstories.
G: That's for sure. I wonder how she ended up in that cave in the first place, though. I've never seen another Tropius in Johto!

	G: Pretending it was a Fire/Ground Type makes it more devistating that Honoa was fainted at the time. Water attacks would've saved me there.
	S: I doubt your young Chinchao could've made any substancial impact on a /real/ Groudon. It wouldn't even have a 4x weakness because it's not part Fire Type.
	G: You never know! He /did/ just defeat a Ho-Oh at that point.
	S: [Sigh]
	G: Would you have even been interested in a Camerupt anyways? I feel like Pokémon with huge common weaknesses like /Water/ would've bothered you.
	S: If it was avalible for what I would've seen as a low price I might've picked it up, but also probably would've tried to trade it once I saw another option later depending on how I rated its preformance...
	G: All about the numbers, huh?
	S: That's how I was.

S: It's a week normal type with no evolutions, unique moves, abilities, mega forms...

//G: [Dreamy] I love my Konkurs...

//G: [sweats] Well... Actually, when I found him, he was wearing a collar.
//S: A collar?
//G: It was more like a metal ring? It had a lot of mechanical bits on it. It wasn't hard for me to unlatch, I just had to press a button and pull, but It was definitely something that no Trapinch could get on their own.
//G: The collar had a Team Rocket R on it.

//G: But he has me now! And I'll do anything to protect him.

S: Maybe she was hiding.
G: Why would you say that?
S: You said it yourself, Tropius don't live in caves. Some way or another, she ended up here. Maybe because she was traded and someone released her, maybe because she flew her herself from Hoenn, but either way- Tropius prefer sunlight naturally. Her time in the caves was unhealthy, and you had to put in a large effort to get her back to normal. So, why would she be in a cave instead of roaming the land?
G: I wish we could just talk to the Pokemon so we could just ask. I mean, I of course be fine if she didn't want to talk about it.

//S: It can barely attack, it's body can't sustain barely any damage, and the only respectable thing it can do in terms of battling is go fast, but that doesn't mean very much when it has nothing to hit with. There's an abundance of water Pokemon that are far easier to train and outclass it in every regard easily. Not to mention out professors giving out water Pokemon as an option.

G: This older man named Kurt was really upset about it. He battled one of the grunts, but ended up falling into the well and injuring himself!
G: I would not stand for this injustice! They were hurting innocent pokemon, and now this old man was hurt! I knew it was probably a bad idea, but I figured I had a shot since they were just grunts and not actual serious trainers.
G: With my team comprised of a Kirlia, Houndour, Skitty, and Chinchou, I beat them. Without any more Pokemon, they were defenseless and left.\x
G: I didn't stay in the town very long. I picked up my second gym badge, then decided to head out to Ilex Forrest.
G: But just as I was leaving, [wrapping arm around Silver's shoulder, pointing at his cheek]
S: Uhg... 
G: The last time I saw him is when he heartlessly attacked my defenseless baby Ralts. Needless to say, I was not happy to see him.
G: Thing is, I wasn't actually expecting to ever see him again. I saw him once, and I told professor elm that he's the one that stole the Pokemon.
G: Sorry about that, by the way.
S: Whatever.
G: I figured that maybe the pokemon he stole from the lab would have gotten taken away, and I'd just never be involved with him again.
G: But /evidently/ [nudges] that didn't happen.
S: If only.
G: He couldn't believe that I actually beat team rocket! I mean, neither could I to be honest, then he challenged me to a battle.
G: I felt much more prepared going in. This was my chance for revenge!
G: I sent out Honoa as my first Pokémon, thinking "Honoa has Volt Absorb! Silver's Electric Type can't do anything to it!
G: Turns out, I was wrong. I was winning it first, using Water Gun while silver fruitlessly tried to make an Electric Attack work. He /realized/ my Pokemon had Volt Absorb though, and switch to focusing on dodging and using Tackle instead!
G: Honoa was really close, but ended up fainting before the Flaaffy did. So, I sent out Silklay my Kirlia.
G: Last time we had fought this thing, it was a Mareep, and she was a Ralts. But she was stronger now. She wouldn't let the same thing that had happened before happen again. She was out for revenge!
G: She used confusion on the already weakened Mareep, and with the last of its strength it used a huge Thunder Shock!
G: Silklay had done it. She had beat the Mareep. But in the process she had weakened herself, and I sent her back to her Pokéball.\x
G: Then Silver reaches to his Pokéballs and pulls out a fucking /Regice./
S: It wasn't a Regice.
G: Sure as hell felt that way at the time! It was this giant scary monster I've never seen before that was trying to attack me and my tiny Pokemon!
G: All I could think to do was throw out Atticus, call for Ember and hope for the best!
G: And that thing /melted./ Not literally, I'm not a Poké-murderer, but it went down /so/ fast. I honestly couldn't believe it, I was so scared! And now it was just... Gone!
S: [Grimaces] \x
G: Silver sent out his last Pokemon. A /Groudon./
S: Wasn't a Groudon, it was a Magmortar.
G: I was lucky with the Regice. I had Atticus, and he was super effective against it! But now... Fire was useless. This thing was way stronger than us, even if Atticus could get close enough to bite it, he's just a puppy! This thing was a fully evolved Pokemon!
G: He tried really hard, but there was nothing he could do. We got /obliterated./
G: My Chinchou was fainted, my Kirlia was near-faint and wouldn't be very strong against this thing anyways, so all I had left was... Norma, the Skitty. Who I had named Norma, because her boring Normal Type was all I thought of her.
G: Out of options, I sent her out, and called for Sing.
G: Before my eyes, the Groudon stumbled, and fell to the ground, snoring. Recognizing this chance, I called for tackle. She dump jumped for it, I called tackle, again, again! Slowly, she chiped away at the monster, getting hit after hit, as it slept.
G: Silver yelled for the Groudon to wake up, but any time it started to get up, Skitty would sing again, putting it right back to sleep.
G: Until finally, the Pokémon got up... and fell, fainted.
G: I owed Normal Types an APOLOGY. Skitty had not only just beat the Groudon, but SAVED MY PRIDE AS WELL. She /never/ left my team after that!
S: And you made up an entire story, just for her.
G: It's not made up! You were there, you know what happened!
S: Just without the Regice or Groudon...
G: Close enough!
S: Magmortar isn't even a Fire/Ground Type...
G: I learned the real power of Normal Types then. They have sooo much flexibility and know so many weird moves.
G: So, thanks RIVAL, you got me to be a better trainer and learn how to kick your ass better in the future!

//G: So, Tala: She's mostly a Grass Type Pokemon Trainer. She wants a bunch of Pokemon that can help her out with her garden. Cool, neat, interesting, good for her.
//G: So she decides one day that she wanted a Vespiquen. Since bee Pokemon are good for Grass Types, and all. They can pollinate the flowers and provide honey and whatever else.
//G: She found a stray Combee floating over the water, and caught it to make it part of her team... Now, the thing is that only like one in every ten Combee is a girl that can evolve into Vespiquen.
//G: The once she caught was a boy, so she went over to our grandparent's daycare to have it make more Combee eggs.
//G: She was COMPLETELY OBSESSED with building "The Hive" for the next MONTH. Hatching Combee eggs, training young little Combee to teach them how to fight, hyping them up about the eventual queen that will hatch, bonding with all of them, hatching more eggs...
//G: After WEEKS of this, she FINALLY got one that was a girl. She had all her other Combee she had spent all months hatching help her train the princess, until they ALL helped her evolve into a Vespiquen!
//G: That Vespiquen is spoiled rotton as far as Pokemon go! I mean, she's got an entire ARMY of brother Combee to help her out... and also her weird brother, Cameron, who's a Paras, but I don't think he knows that.

//S: It was rather over the top...

//G: It seems pretty unfair for the Buneary. People shouldn't *force* a Pokemon to like them... It doesn't work that way.
//G: Unless it's got an injury or something that makes it somehow worse for it to live in the wild, there's not really an excuse to raise them... and even then, they'd probably do better with actual professional rehibilitation groups or wildlife reserves than with selfish trainers who just want a Lopunny.

CUBCHOO_BEARTIC

Redesign by Subjectively
S: To be /perfectly/ clear: Beartic is the Pokemon I used to have. To get it, I went on the computers in the basement of the Pokécenter that are all used specifically just for the purpose of trading with other trainers, and found someone online offering it in return for an Onix holding a Metal Coat.
S: I already had an Onix because I caught one while I was traveling through a cave, thinking it would be valuable for trading.
S: Onix has the unfortunate Rock/Ground Type, one of the worst dual types there is with two four times weaknesses to Grass and water, two types that nearly every trainer has, then a weakness to fighting, ground, steel, and ice.
S: Steelix however drops the rock type for a steel type, which makes it a ground/steel type. This is orders of magnitude better than what it used to be, and it only evolves into Steelix when traded with a metal coat, making it a valuable pokemon.
S: I had to go out and find a metal coat. One of my Pokemon at the time knew the move Thief and we managed to find one on a wild Magnemite.
S: I got the Metal Coat, Went back to the Pokécenter, found the same trade offer still up, then traded that low value Onix for the higher value Beartic.
S: /I know it's wrong to rank Pokemon by being high value or low value, I'm just explaining my thought process at the time./
S: The Beartic did well in training, so when I battled Gold again I used it. His Houndour defeated it so quickly that the next chance I got I went back to the Pokécenter I traded it away for a different Pokémon.
S: I treated it like it was just a tool for my disposal. I feel sorry I treated pokémon that way, and I hope it found a better trainer than me.

	G: How would you describe the /texture/ of Heatmore? Scaley? Fuzzy? Smooth?

	G: Oh- Yeah, that's for sure. Wouldn't want to deal with the nasty burn it could give me if it decided to attack.
	S: It is important to excersize an extra amount of care around Fire Types. While most Pokémon can be dangerous, Fire Types are especially so, since they can also damage the area around them.
	G: Right, if you get hit with a high pressure Water attack, you might be dead and whatever behind you might need cleaning, but if you upset a Fire Type??? They could burn down buildings and forests if they wanted to!
	G: I'm so glad Atticus has always been so well behaved... If a Fire Type likes you, then their flames don't even hurt!

	G: I love Larvesta and Volcorona! They're so colorful! They honestly look like they could be Bug/Dragon types.
	S: They're Bug/Fire Types, which, as far as Bug Type combinations go, isn't that bad.
	G: It's such an interesting type too! I feel like watching a Volcarona fight adds to its beauty... A beautiful multicolored monster surrounded by scarlet flames that accentuate its beauty...
	G: I also like the white fur they have on them. Imagine there was a variation that's fur was thicker, and grew on more of their body, and it was a Bug/Ice Type instead.
	S: Bug/Ice is one of the worst Type combination you could possibly have.
	G: It would be pretty though! And it's Volcorona, it'll probably still kick ass.
	S: One of the most substantial reasons that Volcarona is as good as it is is because of its type. If you took that away, it would have none of the battling prowess that it normally possesses.
	G: If a Pokemon is not good at battling, does that mean it doesn't deserve to live? Will you never give these furry little worms a chance?
	S: Whatever, I'm just commenting on the battling part of it because that's what I'm knowledgeable about.

	S: Well don't blame me when one of them ends up digging up a pipe and you have to pay for it.
	G: Just tell them to put all the dirt back in the hole! Problem solved.
	S: Definitely not in all cases, especially if it breaks one...
	G: It's just part of its nature to do so! You can't get mad at it for  just following its instincts! Us humans are the one encroaching, after all! Putting our things in the floor when it belongs to the Pokémon...

FETCHLING_FLETCHINDER_TALONFLAME

G: [Hands over mouth puppy eyes] Fetchling is sooooo small! I met a trainer with one once and they let me pet theirs... I'll never forget it.
S: The other Fire Flying/Types are Ho_Oh, Moltres, Charizard, and an Oricorio... So while there are a few known Pokémon with the Type, three out of four of them are rare Pokémon... Legendaries being rare and ellusive, Charmander's rarity outside from labs, and Oricoro not being avalible in too many regions.
G: Oohh cool! I like that type... Let me think, Flying is weak to Electric Rock and Ice, Fire resists Ice so it balances out Flying's weakness, Fire is weak to Water, Ground and Rock Type, Flying is immune Ground so nullifies that, and is also weak to Rock... Rock Types aren't the /most/ common though, so just avoid that 4x weakness and that sounds like a pretty good combo.

S: It's just a butterfly, and one I'll /bet/ you've never actually seen. you have no reason to be so defensive.
G: Of course I do! I said I liked something, and you immediately went and knocked it! It's like you're trying to tell me I'm not allowed to like it because of your self-centered perception of what makes a good Pokémon.
G: And, /yeah/, it is self-centered, because you only ever think about Pokemon in terms of "strength", AKA, what they can do in battle, AKA, what they can do for /you/.
S: Fine you can like your multicolored butterfly. Whatever. You obviously care more than I do.
G: Thank you!

//G: Psychic/Dark Type, huh? That sounds really interesting! Psychics are real' powerful in Kanto, since there's no Dark Types, not a lot of strong bugs, and super rare Ghost Types too.
//G: Combining Phsychic with one of its weaknesses sounds like it might help it out in other regions.
//S: Does it now?
//G: Let me think... With the Dark Type, instead of being super-effective, it would take nuetral damage to Dark, and Ghost, since Phsychic is weak but Dark resists...
//G: It would take way more damage from Bugs, though, since Phychic /and/ Dark are weak to those...
//G: It'd me immune to Psychic, but not a lot of people are fighting Psychic Pokemon with Psychic moves since it's /already/ resistant...
//G: Psychic resists Fighting, but Dark is weak to it so that's neutral damage...

S: Only Dragalge is a Dragon Type. It's pre-evolution, Skrelp, is part Water.
G: Ooh interesting. Wouldn't you normally say that water is the better of those two types to keep?
S: As a Water/Dragon Type it would have huge resistance to Fire and Water Type, but Dual Poison isn't the /worst/. You have to keep in mind the region that Dragalge is from.
G: That being... Kalos?
S: Right. And in Kalos there are Fairy Types. Dragon Types have more of an uphill battle there, as there's more resistance. Fairy type is weak to Poison Type, so having a Dragon Type that can hit it for super effective damage is valuable.

{/*
G: What /are/ Xerneas and Yveltal anyways? Are they one-of-a-kind region-creating gods like Dialga and Palkia, just rare powerful normal Pokémon like Zapdos and Moltres, something inbetween?
S: They are said to be involved with the life and death of all living things...
G: So definitely more on the Dialga and Palkia side of things.
S: It's far from confirmed, but there are many that sincerely hold this belief in the Kalos region. Regardless if they're behind /all/ life and death, though, they do certainly have powers over it.
G: Go on...
S: Xerneas spend most of their life as a tree, while Yveltal spends most of its life as a cacoon. When they awaken, they're said to cause life around them to either bloom or decay, respectively.
S: One of Xerneas' awakenings is rumored to have been the begining of Kalos.
G: Is it possible there might be more outside of Kalos?
S: Yes, in fact it's likely. Though, as I said, they spend most of their life inanimate. They only rise once a millennium, and, being Legendary, they're hard to track.
S: That isn't to say that people haven't tried, though.
S: Desparate hunts for Xerneas to give them immortality or revive someone, and Yveltal for the power to destroy for conquest and power.
G: How do you know so much about them?
S: ...Legendary Pokémon are usually the most interesting to read about.

G: It sounds pretty realistic to me, I remember tala once told me a story about the timesheet her gloom against an Oddish. Since they were both grass poison types, they weren't able to damage each other or even have their status moves work on each other. It was just super slow fight.
S: Why didn't she just switch out?
G: Oh they both did eventually.
G: The Zygarde in Tangrowth didn't have that option though.
G: Also, Tangrowth was the one that won at the end.
S: And let me guess, the trainer of that Tangrowth was you?

G: I thought there was only one "mirage island". Are there more?

G: Oooh, really? I don't think there are any other Fire/Water types.
S: Not that are known, no. There are a few different volcanions that have been documented throughout history, but they're incredibly rare.
G: How good is Fire/Water as a type, anyway?
S: It's pretty good, both offensively and defensively. Fire and water intuitively balance each other out. Though, they can't do anything to water or dragon types.
G: I wish there was a Pokémon that wasn't mythical with this type. Then you could actually see people use it in battle!

	G: Sounds a lot more localized than other Pokemon! Most of them you can take with you anywhere.
	S:  It's at least a deterrent from making people take them out of their environment.

G: Didn't you basically think the same thing of Skitty? That it was incredibly weak and useless, even though it singlehandedly beat your Groudon and then won the JOHTO LEAGUE, then as a Delcatty, the Kanto League?
S: It's not because of the inherent strength of the Pokemon, I'll tell you that much.
G: Do you think if I could win the league twice with an "weak" kittycat, maybe winning could be more about strategies and teamwork than it is just having strong Pokémon?

G: It's always better to /start off/ assuming a Pokémon is dangerous instead of finding out once it's too late.
S: It's mostly notable for knowing unique healing moves- If species wise it /was/ trying to decieve people to murder them, it would probably be at /least/ part Ghost or Dark Type rather than pure Fairy.

SNOM_FROSMOTH

G: Out of all the pokemon I don't have........... Snom and Frosmoth I love the most. Well, maybe not the most, but definitely top ten.
S: It's an Ice/Bug Type...
G: Well yeah of course it is. "Frosmoth" might as well be "Ice-Bug". It's literally its name.
S: Bug and ice are the two worst types there are, and they don't combine together to cover for either's numerous weaknesses. It has /two/ different four times weaknsesses in Fire and Rock.
G: I think it's fair to call bug the worst type, but I don't know if you could really say Ice is /that/ bad. It has pretty good offense, and is definitely your most reliable option against dragon types.
S: Just teach an ice type move to a Pokemon that isn't actually an ice type. That way you can actually /use/ that offense instead of getting instantly knocked off the field.
S: Especially once you combine /bug/.
G: Well, I'm definitely not a coward. A Pokemon's inherent strengths and weaknesses matter less than how they're raised and their bond with their trainer.
S: Which is the polite way of saying some Pokémons only value is in the eyes of those that care for it.
G: That's not what I meant! If you love and care for a Pokemon enough, they /do/ genuinely get stronger! Any Pokémon could be as strong as any Dragon if you care enough.
S: The truth of the matter is that if you put the same amount of love and care into a Sunkern as you do a Haxerous, the Haxerous will be always be stronger.
G: What about the Champion's Butterfree? It didn't sit on the sidelines, it was one of the star Pokémon that fight.
S: You can't put into question the entire concept of strength and weakness just off one preformance, especially considering her untested opponent.
G: When I first met you you advocated for nothing but the strength of Pokemon being all that matters. Time and time again you lost over and over to "weaklings" while your unevolved or otherwise less powerful Pokémon outpreformed the stronger ones.
G: You /gave up/ the more powerful ones /specifically because you realized raw strength isn't everything/. How can you believe that /and/ believe not every Pokémon can be strong?
S: ...A cared for Pokémon is stronger than an uncared for Pokémon. Once on an even field, though, natural strength once again matters. A cared for Dragon is always going to be stronger than a cared for Bug. The Bug may win sometimes, it may pull out some strategies to overcome the foe, but the Bug is always the one struggling, not the Dragon.
G: But if the bug were /part Ice Type,/ then it has an advantage.
G: Pokémon strengths and weaknesses aren't "which is always stronger in every situation", every Pokémon has both. A Fire Type will struggle against a Water Type, but will have the advantage over a Grass Type.
G: Not every situation is fit for every Pokémon, but every Pokémon has a place. INCLUDING FROSMOTH!!
S: I don't think there's any changing your mind...

G: Awww

G: I love Wo-Chien, who has an appearance reminiscent of autumn fallen leaves, intricate and thought-provoking image, powerful presence...
G: I love Chi-Yu, confusing to meet at first but once I realized that it was a /fish made out of fire/ I can do nothing but stare at it now.
G: ALL OF THESE POKEMON ARE GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL. I LOVE THEM nad I WANT ONE /so bad/, but /as it turns out,/ they're suuuuper rare Legendaries that barely anyone has ever seen.
G: I am fucking ROBBED.
S: What about Ting-Lu?
G: That one is take it or leave it. It's a deer made of blocks, whatever.

/* POKEMON TO ADD LATER
- redo Seel
- Regional Variants
- Paradox forms
	They don't know about them in universe, so instead the user would be handing them a piece of paper with a picture of them and ask them their opinion
- Move starters to Aitalk and have them actually comment on them individually
- Mega Forms
- Mazah region
Could ask Project Untamed for help?
- The Fakémon I have downloaded
Might need to ask for permission on some of them?
