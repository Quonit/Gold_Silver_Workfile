		//S: Aren't they all lizards...?

		//G: In Kanto you can find Caterpie, Metapod, and Butterfree *everywhere*. If you went into the forest and said you didn't see any, I wouldn't believe you!
		//G: There are a bunch of young trainers with them too, since they're so easy to capture.
		//S: Most of those trainers end up releasing the Butterfree later.
		//G: Well... Yeah, that's true. Butterfree have a migration cycle, and trainers pretty much always let them go for that.
		//S: Their team's viability is better off without the Pokemon anyways. Butterfree's uses are fairly limited to teaching young trainers the bear basics of raising a pokemon, as it's easy to catch and evolves quickly.
		//G: You're making it sound as if the only people who would ever even think of raising a Butterfree are young kids!
		//S: More people *would* think of raising a Butterfree, but weather serious trainers *should* is different.
		//S: Butterfree are good Pokemon for education, gardening, pets, decoration. They're useful for people who aren't Pokemon trainers but still want just one to protect them on common routes.
		//S: However, they're completely unsuitable for serious competition. Their Bug/Flying Typing gives them many, many common weaknesses and very few strengths. They are incredibly frail, especially physically but how they fare against special attacks isn't anything impressive either. They're easily outsped by anything not anchored to the ground in some way. 
		//S: It can't hit hard physically, and hundreds of Pokemon easily outclass it in what it can do with its Special Attack. The nieche it has going for it is that it has compound eyes that raise its accuracy, making the usually unreliable powders that inflicting Sleep, Stun, and Poison practical.
		//S: There are other Pokemon, even among common ones that are easily caught, that can still inflict those statuses that are better in every other regard.
		//G: Are you mad because the Kanto Champion has one?
		//S: You mean the /former/ Kanto Champion who hasn't been seen in months, who only won due to an embarrassing fluke on the system's part because her same-aged child rival had managed to become Champion right before, meaning THAT'S who her opponant was instead of an actual expert?
		//G: I mean... I wouldn't write, uh... the former Kanto Champion off so soon, 'still had to get all the badges and through the Elite Four.
		//G: Plus, the whole Team Rocket thing! You've gotta have some respect for that, right? You hate those guys.
		//S: Anyone with enough guts to attempt it can beat Team Rocket. They're all incompetant bumbling fools and it's a testament to their ineffectuality that they were beaten by a trainer who relies on Butterfree.
		//G: Or maybe the world is more flexible than you think? Maybe it's just possible that if you love a Pokemon enough and are a good enough trainer, then any of them can be better?
		//G: And, like, maaaaayyyybe the reason most Butterfree don't do so well is because those little kids that catch them all the time don't know or care to train them to their full potential? Especially since a lot of them release them so soon.
		//S: You're unlikely to convince me on this point.
		//G: For someone who doesn't like Butterfree, you sure do have a lot to say about it compared to other Pokemon you think are weak... Usually you just write them off, not go on an angry rant.

		//G: Poor Pichu and Raichu, though... There are some people who doesn't even know Raichu EXISTS because of how popular Pikachu is! They're like... What do you mean it can evolve! Why would I do that!
		//G: So, Pokedex. How Pokemon are indexed is that you give the first Pokemon in an evolution line a number, so, like, number 25. Then the second number is how many times it's evolved. It'd be like, Pichu 25.0, Pikachu 25.1, and then Raichu 25.2. And 25 would be known as "The Pichu Line".
		//EXCEPT, this is the ONLY LINE where it's NOT named after the first Pokemon in the evolution! It's just CALLED the Pikachu line! Because they only indexed Pichu later and didn't want to change it.
		//S: I heard there's a rare evolution after Raichu.
		//G: Whaaat? No way, you're joking.
		//S: There's no pictures of it, but there's some documents describing a pokemon evolved from Raichu named "Gorochu".

		G: When I first met you you advocated for nothing but the strength of Pokemon being all that matters. Time and time again you lost over and over to "weaklings" while your unevolved or otherwise less powerful Pokémon outpreformed the stronger ones.
		G: You /gave up/ the more powerful ones /specifically because you realized raw strength isn't everything/. How can you believe that /and/ believe not every Pokémon can be strong?
		S: ...A cared for Pokémon is stronger than an uncared for Pokémon. Once on an even field, though, natural strength once again matters. A cared for Dragon is always going to be stronger than a cared for Bug. The Bug may win sometimes, it may pull out some strategies to overcome the foe, but the Bug is always the one struggling, not the Dragon.

		G: Not every situation is fit for every Pokémon, but every Pokémon has a place. INCLUDING FROSMOTH!!
