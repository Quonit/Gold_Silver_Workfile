The Red and Blue shell for Gold and Silver.  Assuming that you're in here, it must mean you're snooping through the files! Facinating.

I made two seperate shells because it's divided on what eye color the characters have, and at first I was going to just make two shells where the eye color was different. Then I decided if I'm having two shells, might as well change all of the colors so that the eye color fits more. It was just fun to make.

This shell uses more cool tones.
